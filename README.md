#MemeMe

MemeMe is the second project for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. It's the capstone app for the UIKit Fundamentals course.

Users can choose a photo from the iPhone's camera roll, snap a photo with the iPhone's camera, and then add text at the top of the bottom of the screen to create a meme. The user can then share the meme through text, email, or social media through UIKit's UIActivityViewController. Each shared meme is temporarily saved to a model, and the user can choose to see the set of recently shared memes using either a UITableView or a UICollectionView.
